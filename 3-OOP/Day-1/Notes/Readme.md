# .NET Architecture Components
* There are many frameworks included in .NET 6.0
    * A framework are just predefined classes and libraries to help us start an application
    * One framework we will be using in the future is ASP.NET (Used to create Web Apis)
## SDK vs Runtime
### SDK
* Software Development Kit
* Includes everything we need to build and run a .NET application
    * Such as Command-Line interface commands to create our projects as well as a bunch of other functionalities
* SDK includes Runtime as well why? Well when you develop an application you of course need to run it to be able to test if everything is working properly
### Runtime
* It includes all the resources we need to run existing .NET application
* A lot less storage required to download and install
* Mostly useful for end-users (people who will be using our application)

# Common Language Infrastructure (CLI)
* This is the  infrastructure of .NET on how it is able to write your application in numerous programming language beyond C# and for your application to be run on any operating system
## General structure of the CLI
* CLS
    * CTS
    * VES
        * CLR
## CLS
* Common Language Specification
* It has defined rules and restrictions that every langauge must follow for it to be able to run the .NET framework
* Essentially a standardization to make sure a language won't do anything that will make it incompatible with .NET framework
## CTS
* Common Type System
* Provides a library of the basic value data types
* It is a standardization of data types to ensure every language will follow the same datatype
    * Ex: int in C# is the same 32-bit memory as the int in Visual Basic
* Helps create **Language Interoperability**
    * Fancy way of saying .NET has the capability to develop application using two or more programming languages
    * You can create apps using Visual Basic, C#, J# (Java-like language that can run in .NET), etc.
        * NEVER SAY JAVA ITSELF J# IS NOT JAVA
## VES
* Run-time system of CLI that provides all the tools it needs to be able to execute your application
### CLR
* Common Language Runtime implements VES so anything in VES, CLR also has it plus more
* Essentially, it is .NET's version of VES
* Run-time environment that provides services that make the development process easier
* Some servies it includes:
    * Automatic memory management (older languages you ahve to manually release unused resources)
    * JIT compilation (Just-inTime compilation that involves compliation during execution for optimization)
        * It just means any new compile code gets executed immediately, it doesn't have to wait until your entire code has been compiled to run your app
    * Exception handling support
