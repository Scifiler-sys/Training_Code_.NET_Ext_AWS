## Add Unit tests validation for the majority of your models
* Start looking into possible methods you can use in Assert to have a good idea what you can cross check to ensure validation is working properly
* Make sure you arrange your unit testing in the AAA (Arrange, Act, Assert) format
* Don't forget the data annotation above the method to treat it as a unit test
```
dotnet test - executes testing process
dotnet new xunit - creates the xunit framework project for testing
```
