## Creating a normalized DB architecture from the PNG
* Start from just creating possible tables you need
* Start thinking about the relationships between each table
* You can always start with 1NF and add primary key to each table and if you only have one primary key you also inheritly done 2NF
* Database architecture is not enough and make sure each table also hold the information stated on the PNG
* At the end, you should be able to select statement Bob the builder and inner join it with a bunch of other tables and essentially display the same information as the PNG
