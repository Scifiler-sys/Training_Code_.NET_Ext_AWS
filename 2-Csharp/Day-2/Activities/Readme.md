# Group Activity
* You will present the menu app to everyone on Friday.
* We will continue building this menu app as we learn more and more topics this week.
* If you need help, your group mates are your best resource so ask them before you ask me anything.
* You will be in groups but you have the capabilities to go to different breakout rooms so if your group doesn't know how to do something maybe start exploring and collaborating with other groups.
## Re-create your old shell menu using C# language
1. Create a new console project in your working directory name MenuC
    * Hint: you must use dotnet CLI command to achive this
2. Create a different C# file named Menu.cs as I did in my demo
3. Create a Menu class and put in all the class members you think you'll need to re-create your shell menu
4. Push all the changes to your remote github repo.
