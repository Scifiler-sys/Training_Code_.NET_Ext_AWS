## Re-create your old shell menu using C# language
1. Create a new console project in your working directory name MenuC
    * Hint: you must use dotnet CLI command to achive this
2. Create a different C# file named Menu.cs as I did in my demo
3. Create a Menu class and put in all the class members you think you'll need to re-create your shell menu
4. Push all the changes to your remote github repo.
