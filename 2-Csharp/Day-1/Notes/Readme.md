# Introduction to .NET 6.0
* It is a free, open-souce development platform for a variety of applications (Games, websites, console, etc)
* Essentially, it is a collection of languages and libraries that can work together to build many different types of applications
## Different types of open-source developer platform
* They decided to group certain functionalities with different names in .NET
1. .NET 6.0
    * The one you have right now
    * It supports the most types of apps and platforms since it is the combination of both .NET Core and .NET Framework
2. .NET Core
    * Just the older version of .NET 6.0
3. .NET Framework
    * It is used to exclusively create windows-only desktop applications
## What is C#?
* It is an object-oriented and type-safe programming language
    * Object-oriented means everythign is based on objects and classes and the relationships between them
    * Type-safe meaning once you set a datatype you can't change the datatype (unless you use certain techniques to do it)

# What is Object-Oriented programming?
* It is a methodology we use to design our programs just using classes and objects
* It makes it a lot easier to develop and maintain your project as it gets bigger
## Classes
* They are templates that are used to create objects and define the object's functions and current state (essentially what information they currently store)
## Objects
* It is any entity that has a state and behavior
* They are made from classes and will copy whatever state and behavior the class has defined
## Overall
* Classes are blueprints and Objects is the actual object from the blueprint
* Ex: 
    A blueprint of a car, tells you how to make a car but it isn't the car itself (The Class)
    The multiple cars you make from same blueprint (The Objects of that Class)
