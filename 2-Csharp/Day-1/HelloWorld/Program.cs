//Program.cs is the implicity generated main method that will become the entry point of the program
//As of C# 9.0, they decided to make top-level statements which basically mean you can write less code to do the same operation

//One important thing you just need to know is that the main method is the entry point of your program
Console.WriteLine("Hello, World!");
