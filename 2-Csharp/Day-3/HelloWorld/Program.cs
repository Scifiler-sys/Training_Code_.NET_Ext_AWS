    Naming Conventions in C#:
    - We use PascalCase for the most part and that means naming artifacts as EveryFirstLetterIsCapitalized.
    - We use camelCase for naming fields and that means naming artifacts as onlyTheFirstWordIsNotCapitalized.
    - As you can see, the auto-generated class has PascalCase for most things.
