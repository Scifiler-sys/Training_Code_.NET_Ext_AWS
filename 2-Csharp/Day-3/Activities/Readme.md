3. Add any class members (methods, constructors, properties, fields, etc.) to Data class that you think will be useful to accomplish the following functions 
3. Add function to Menu to add elements to a collection
    * This function might look different depending on what theme you created for your menu app
    * Ex: If it is a shopping app then maybe a cart system would make the most sense
4. Add function to Menu to display all the current elements to a collection
5. Add function to Menu to remove certain elements to a collection
6. Add function to Menu to search for a certain element in a collection
    * Look into C# documentation of what methods are available for you in the collection that you are using that might help you find certain elements
    * You can also just create your own coding logic to find certain elements in a collection
    * If no element exist, be sure to tell the user that the element was not found.
