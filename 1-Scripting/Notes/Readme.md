## Command Line Interface (CLI)
* It is a what you see every time someone is hacking during a movie
* It is an interface (basically mean something you can mess with) that interacts with your computer doing certain operations
* What kind of operations? It can make folders, open folders, or do a plethora of other functionalities
* So why is this important when you can do the same operations (for the most part) with a file explorer?
    * Well in the coding world, there is no such thing as a pretty UI
    * Everyone is more focused on the functionality than adding a nice graphical representation of it
* So get ready to get used to seeing a terminal and messing with it. Down the line, we will add more functionalities to our basic CLI to do cool things
* You will also see that most of the common problems you'll experience is most likely or not the wrong usage of the terminal
