# Installation Process
## .NET 6
* Make sure you click on .NET SDK and NOT runtime
* This gives us the opportunity to start using certain commands
* To test if it is working, open up a new command prompt and type
```
dotnet --version
[Latest .NET 6 verison should popup here]
```
* If that was not the case, restarting your computer might help

## Visual Studio Code (VS code)
* The main Integrated Development Environment (also known as IDE) we will be using
* An IDE is just a tool we will use to write our code in, also run our code and can also give special features that makes everyday life as a developer a lot easier
* Main thing why I'm using VS code is because it is a lightweight IDE and with demo demostration I need something fast to write, code, and run it.

## Visual Studio Community Edition
* The next IDE we will need
* It is like VS code but more hefty with a bunch of features that helps you code
* The start up time takes a while to load and the main reason I will barely use it
* You are free to use it to develop your applications for future projects but you are on your own to figure out how to navigate through the application needed to do the same operations we will do in VS code.

## GIT
* Version Control System
* It is a way for us to keep a history of all the changes we have made to our project
* It also gives powerful capabilities to work as a team when combined with Github
* Very confusing learning for the first time so I suggest using this [link](https://learngitbranching.js.org) to help you get started
