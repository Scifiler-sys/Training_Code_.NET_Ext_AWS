**Use only the terminal to do the following operations**
1. Create a remote repository in Github
    * Naming convention - Firstname-Lastname-Readme
2. Create a local repository inside of the working directory
3. Add readme file to stagging
4. Commit the changes with a meaningful message
5. Add remote origin that points to the remote repository you just created

# Third Phase
**Use only the terminal to do the following operations**
1. Create a new folder in the working directory named Shell
2. Create a shell file inside of the folder

**You can use VS code to edit the shell script file**

3. Create a shell script that will display a menu and the user can select the options in the menu
    * Use control flow and CLI commands to achieve this
    * Research what a terminal menu should look like (a simple google search of "terminal menu" will help you out)
